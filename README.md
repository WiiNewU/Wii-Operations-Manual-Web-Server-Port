# Wii-Operations-Manual-Web-Server-Port

This is the Wii operations manual. a vWii (Wii U Wii Mode) app that was essentially just a mini web site hosted on the Wii. 
I dumped the files and is displayable/hosted on a web server or just opening the index.html file on a web browser. 
It is recommended to have the Wii fonts installed on your system so it can render some icons/text correctly. 
This is for Nintendo of America region in English. Wii sound effect do not play in this web version.
